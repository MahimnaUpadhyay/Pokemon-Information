# Pokemon-Information
Made a basic Pokemon Information program with the help of PokeBase API.
User can enter pokemon name and basic information will be given according to command they have opt. 
As I make more changes in program I will keep updating the code. Further more you can download API from PyPi.org and search PokeBase API.
