# Pokemon-Information
Made a basic Pokemon Information program with the help of PokeBase API.
User can enter pokemon name and basic information will be given according to command they have opt. 
As I make more changes in program I will keep updating the code. Further more you can download API from PyPi.org and search PokeBase API.

Note:- If you're using JIO as Internet Service Provider (ISP) then JIO has blocked some GitHub Features, It is advisedly to switch to different network to run code Thank You.
